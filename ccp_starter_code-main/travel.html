                <p>Last semester I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain. I lived in the La Latina neighborhood in a 8 person flat. 3 of my roommates where from Umich. 2 of them were from Spain. One of them was from France. The last roommate was from Italy. I loved my time in Spain. I thought that La Latina was the perfect location for me.</p>

                <p>My last place that I visited when I was abroad was Positano, Italy. This was my favorite location for several reasons that I will list below. I traveled to Positano with my Brother and my Girlfriend. The food was so amazing and the views of the sea was stunning.</p>
